1. Farm

In the far future people on Mars developed multiple special plants with special effects, which were able to grow food more efficiently based on their nature.  
There could be 3 types of plants on a farm: almond trees, spruces and junipers. At least 2 of every type is present.  
The farm knows the total food produced.  
All plants produce food every month (Spruce-26, Almond-50, Juniper-14), which can be boosted or reduced by different events. Every month the production of each is growing by 4 by default. Since Spruces and Junipers are evergreens, they can grow leaves on their own every 5 months, increasing their production by 8. These two can also be at max production at 70 (can't be more 	than that), at that point they speak and say "<Name> at full production!".  
*Almond trees, on the other hand, are very effective, when their production falls below 40, it is doubled! 
Both almond trees and spruces have special attributes, they can grow a shroom every month, which have a chance (almond: 8%, spruce: 5%) that boosts the production by (almond: 10, spruce: 15) of that plant. Both plants can also rot every month with a chance of (almond: 13%, spruce: 4%) which reduces their production by (almond: 18, spruce: 20).  
Shroom growing always happens first!  
If any plant roots, no food is produced that month at all.  
What is the production total on the farm after 80 months?
